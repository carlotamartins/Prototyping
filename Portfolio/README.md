## How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Create a secrets file for your Cohere API key. Create a file at .streamlit/secrets.toml with the following content:
[cohere]
api_key = "your-real-cohere-api-key"

# 4. Run the app
streamlit run diabetes_st_final.py

## How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Add your Cohere key (replace this line in the script with os.getenv if needed)
echo "your-cohere-key" > cohere.key

# 4. Run the app
streamlit run diabetes_st_final.py
